# OS-EX-1-Assembling-the-System---CASE-STUDY

### AIM:

To build the complete assembly of the Computer System

STEPS:
STEP 1: Open The Case
The First Step In Assembling A Computer Is To Open The Computer Case. To Open The Case, First Remove The Screws Of The Left Side Cover And Slide The Side Cover
